# [WIP] stories 

* outcomes, outcomes, outcomes
* people struggle to detach themselves from the implementation
* curse of knowledge
* people don't want a drill they want holes
* everything is always an mvp
* templates but they don't matter so much
* what matters is when is it done?
* the myth of "technical" stories
* story writing is like tdd for your product
* red, green, refactor
* all the similarities apply
* you start with a failing test
* you do the simplest thing to make it pass
* then you refactor and let good design emerge
* you don't start with the solution, you start with the smallest possible mess
* small
* minimize risk
* minimize wip
* chore vs. story
* if it's not in the backlog it's not work worth doing
* find an example
